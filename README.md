# Push_Swap

This is an early project at 42 school that required us to implement a custom stack sorting algorithm using only a limited set of instructions, in order to familiarize us with big O notation.

You have two stack, the arguement of the program will be the first stack content, by performing operation like rotation and push to the other stack you should sort the first stack and display the list of opperation you did, your grade depend on what treeshold you manage to hit.

I wanted to implement a quick sort like algorythm but i failed at the recrusive task.
Pressed by time i started a second version using the radix algorythm that this time worked.

my thoughs on this project :

it was a fun project to work on, i was a little sad at the time that i didn't manage to implement my first idea but I was still able to make the project work without spending to mutch time on it.
