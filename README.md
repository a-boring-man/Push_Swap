# Push_Swap

This is an early project at 42 school that required us to implement a custom stack sorting algorithm using only a limited set of instructions, in order to familiarize us with big O notation.

You have two stacks. The argument of the program will be the contents of the first stack. By performing operations such as rotation and pushing to the other stack, you should sort the first stack and display the list of operations you performed. Your grade depends on the threshold you manage to hit.

I wanted to implement a quicksort-like algorithm, but I failed at the recursive task.
Pressed by time, I started a second version using the radix algorithm, which this time worked correctly.

## Thoughs

I had a lot of fun working on this project. I was a little disappointed at the time that I wasn't able to implement my first idea, but I was still able to make the project work without spending too much time on it.
